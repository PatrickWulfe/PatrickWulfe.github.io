const _aboutMe = '''
I was born in a city of magic and technology, where wizards and engineers worked together to create wonders and innovations. I had a talent for both fields, and I dreamed of becoming a software developer, a person who could create programs and applications that ran on magical devices.

I studied hard and learned the basics of coding and magic, but I also had a rebellious streak and a thirst for adventure. I often hacked into the cityâ€™s network and explored the hidden corners of the digital world. I also joined a group of hackers who called themselves the Codebreakers, and who used their skills to expose corruption and injustice in the city.

One day, I received a mysterious message from an unknown sender, who claimed to have a secret that could change the world. I followed the instructions and met the sender in an abandoned warehouse, where I discovered a device that looked like a portal to another dimension. The sender told me that it was a prototype of a new technology that could connect the digital world with the physical world, and that he needed my help to test it.

I agreed, and stepped into the portal, not knowing what awaited me on the other side. I found myself in a land of fantasy and wonder, where dragons flew in the sky and elves lived in the forests. I also realized that I had a new power: I could manipulate the code of reality with my mind.

I decided to explore this new world and use my power for good, but I also faced dangers and enemies along the way. I became a software developer in a fantasy world, and my adventure had just begun.
